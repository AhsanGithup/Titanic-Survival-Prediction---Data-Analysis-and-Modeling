## ðŸ›³ Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Analysis and Modeling

### ðŸ“Œ **Project Description**

This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster to build a machine learning model that predicts survival outcomes. The notebook walks through the full data science pipelineâ€”from data preprocessing and exploration to model building and evaluation.

### ðŸ“‚ **Steps Included**

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Load the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.
* Display dataset structure and types using `.info()`.
* Generate descriptive statistics using `.describe()`.
* Check for and handle missing values.
* Remove duplicate records if present.

#### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Visualize distributions of key features (e.g., Age, Fare, Sex, Class).
* Use correlation maps to identify relationships among features.

#### 3. **Data Transformation**

* Encode categorical variables as needed.
* Feature engineering (if applicable).

#### 4. **Model Building**

* Split data into training and testing sets.
* Train a classification model (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression).
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy and visual comparison of predicted vs. actual outcomes.

### âœ… **Outcome**

The notebook concludes with predictions and a basic evaluation metric (claims 100% accuracy, which should be validated). Visuals and tables support the analysis throughout.
